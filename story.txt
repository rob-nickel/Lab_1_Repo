A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
there was a puppy named Fluffers.

Fluffers loved everybody, except for Jimmy.
Everyone loved Fluffers, except for Jimmy.

Jimmy was a bullfrog, and while most bullfrogs were friendly towards the puppies,
Jimmy had a tragic happening.

Jimmy was crossing the street one day when Fluffers ran smack into him!
Fluffers suffered a bruised nose while Jimmy had a broken leg!
